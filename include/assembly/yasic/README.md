yet another symbolic instruction set
====================================
Yasic is a high-level programming language, that is implemented as a set of fasmg-macroinstruction and its syntax is very depentent on that of fasmg.
Most of its instructions interfere with fasmgs symbols, e.g. `if` of yasic is a redefined `if` of fasmg and macroinstructions must use `If` instead.
The macroinstructions of yasic generate fbc0.
Do not get confused with the repository *yasic*, it is another language.
I am looking forward to solve this contradiction soon.
